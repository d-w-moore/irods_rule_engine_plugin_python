# iRODS Rule Engine Plugin - Python

This C++ plugin provides the iRODS platform a rule engine that allows iRODS rules to be written in Python.

# Build

Building the iRODS Python Rule Engine Plugin requires version 4.2.x of the iRODS software from github (http://github.com/irods/irods).

```
cd irods_rule_engine_plugin_python
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make package
```

# Install

The packages produced by CMake will install the Python plugin shared object file:

`/usr/lib/irods/plugins/rule_engines/libirods_rule_engine_plugin-python.so`

# Configuration

After installing the plugin, `/etc/irods/server_config.json` needs to be configured to use the plugin.

Python rules will be loaded from `core.py` (located at `/etc/irods/core.py` in a default installation).

To activate the plugin, add a new stanza to the "rule_engines" array within `server_config.json`:

```json
{
    "instance_name": "irods_rule_engine_plugin-python-instance",
    "plugin_name": "irods_rule_engine_plugin-python",
    "plugin_specific_configuration": {}
}
```

Adding the Python Rule Engine Plugin stanza above the default "irods_rule_engine_plugin-irods_rule_language" stanza will allow any defined Python rules to take precedence over any similarly named rules in the iRODS Rule Language.

As soon as the stanza is inserted, the iRODS core expects a Python source code module to exist at the path `/etc/irods/core.py`. Once imported by the iRODS server and successfully compile to a Python byte-code file bearing the ".pyc" extension, any functions in the module will be callable as rules as long as they conform to a  calling convention
```
def a_python_rule( rule_args , callback , rei ):
  # ... Python code to be executed in the rule context...
```
although the parameters need not be explicit or even named as they are here; they could in fact be collapsed into a parameter tuple, as in **pyfn(\*x)**. The first argument above, `rule_args`, is a tuple containing the optional, positional parameters fed to the rule function by its caller; these same parameters may be written to, with the effect that the written values will be returned to the caller. The `callback` object is effectively a gateway through which other rules (even those managed by other rule engine plugins) and microservices may be called. Finally, `rei` (also known as "rule exec info") is an object carrying iRODS-related context for the current rule call, including e.g. session variables.

When the plugin is freshly installed, a file `core.py.template` will exist in the directory
`/etc/irods`. This may be copied to `/etc/irods/core.py` , or else an empty `core.py` can be created at that path if the user prefers to begin from scratch.

# Miscellaneous points

- The example `core.py.template` file in this repository contains a Python implementation of all static policy enforcement points (PEPs) from a default `core.re` rulebase.

- This version of the Python Rule Engine Plugin uses the Python 2.7 interpreter.

- Some python identifiers, such as `global_vars` (a lookup for accessing variables of the form `*var` from the `INPUT` line, if present) and `irods_types` (a module containing common struct types used for communicating with microservices) are automatically imported into the python interpreter that executes `core.py`.

# Auxiliary Python modules

Included with the Python Rule Engine Plugin are some other modules that provide a solid foundation of utility for writers of Python rule code.

## `session_vars.py`
This module can be directly imported by `core.py` and contains a function `get_map` used to extract session variables from the `rei` parameter passed to any rule function. An example follows:

```
import session_vars
def get_irods_username (rule_args, callback, rei):
  username = ''
  var_map = session_vars.get_map(rei)
  user_type = rule_args[0] or 'client_user'
  userrec = var_map.get(user_type,'')
  if userrec:
    username = userrec.get('user_name','')
  rule_args [0] = username
```

## `genquery_iterator.py`
Two styles of Python iterator are offered by this module, one allowing convenient
access to GenQuery results from within Python rules.  One iterator allows paged
results of N rows at a time over each iteration (returning between 1 and 256
rows at a time in the form of a Python list):

```
  iter = PREP_genquery_row_list_iterator (
           ["sum(DATA_SIZE)"], "DATA_NAME like 'file_%.dat'", 
           False, # says we want an integer-indexed row, not key-value lookup
           callback , N_rows_per_page=1
  ) 
  for row in iter:  # ---> one row returned with sum of size of matching data objects
    writeLine('serverLog',
      'result = {}'.format( row[0] ))
```

while the other returns each row result via a Python generator object:

```
  for dObj in PREP_genquery_row_iterator("DATA_NAME,DATA_SIZE" , conditions, True, callback):
      callback.writeLine ("serverLog",
        "name = {0} ; size = {1}" . format( dObj['DATA_NAME'], dObj['DATA_SIZE'] )
      )
```
In the case of each iterator, whether paged or generator-driven:
  * The first argument iterator is either a string with comma-separated column names,or a list of column names.
  * Second is the condition, literally the way it would be written in the genquery string.
  * The third argument to the iterator, a Python boolean, is an "as_dict" parameter that specifies whether a python dict (key-value) lookup or an integer-indexable python list is desired to represent each row
